    <p>
      This is a website created by Adomas Skliutas in hopes that it will live
      longer than the human.

      SnakeSocks was a nickname I used in game for a while. I guess the nickname
      had more interactions with people than I did, that's why the site is
      called that.

    <p>Don't waste time.</p>
    <p>Like I do right now creating this site.</p>
    <p>Fuck.</p>
